# COVID Data Exploration Project

## Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing datasets related to COVID-19. The data is imported from Excel to Microsoft SQL Server, where various exploratory analyses and data cleaning operations are performed using SQL queries. The cleaned data is then loaded into Tableau, where a comprehensive dashboard is created to visualize key insights.
